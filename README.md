# 🚗 Car Damage Predictor

## 📌 Project Overview
This **Car Damage Predictor** is a deep learning-based solution designed to classify car damage conditions based on uploaded images. Built as a **Proof of Concept (POC)**, the model achieves **>75% accuracy** and is deployed via a **Streamlit web app**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The project aims to **automate vehicle damage assessment** by categorizing car damage into six predefined categories:

1️⃣ Front Normal  
2️⃣ Front Breakage  
3️⃣ Front Crushed  
4️⃣ Rear Normal  
5️⃣ Rear Breakage  
6️⃣ Rear Crushed  

## 🛠️ Model Training Approaches
To achieve high accuracy, the model was trained using multiple deep learning techniques:

✅ **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**  
✅ **CNN with Regularization**  
✅ **Transfer Learning with EfficientNet**  
✅ **Transfer Learning with ResNet**  

Each approach was evaluated for performance, with the best model integrated into the Streamlit app.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Trained deep learning model** for damage classification
- **Streamlit-based web app** with drag-and-drop image upload
- **>75% classification accuracy**
- **End-to-end ML pipeline** from data preprocessing to deployment
